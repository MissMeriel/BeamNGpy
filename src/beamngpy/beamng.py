class BeamNGPy:
    """
    This class provides methods used to start, interact with, and terminate an
    instance of BeamNG.drive. It enables launching a BeamNG.drive process that
    then stands by for further instructions, including loading of scenarios,
    controlling vehicles, and extracting data from the simulation.

    .. note::
        A BeamNG.drive process stores data locally in a so called ``userpath``.
        Multiple instances should not be set to run in the same userpath, as
        sharing those resources leads to undefined behaviour. Instead, when
        using multiple BeamNG.drive processes, specify unique user paths in the
        constructor.

    Args:
        host (str): Hostname or IP,
                    see :py:mod:`socket`, :py:data:`socket.AF_INET`
        post (int): Port to listen on,
                    see :py:mod:`socket`, :py:data:`socket.AF_INET`
        userpath (str, optional): The userpath BeamNG.drive should run in.
                                  If not specified, BeamNG.drive's default will
                                  be used.
        binary (str, optional): Name of the BeamNG.drive binary to call.


    Attributes:
        host (str): Host given during construction.
        port (int): Port given during construction.
        server (:py:class:`socket.socket`): Server socket clients connect to.
        userpath (str): User path to run BeamNG.drive in. Can be ``None`` to use
                        the default.
        binary (str): The BeamNG.drive binary that will be called.
        process (:py:class:`subprocess.Popen`): BeamNG.drive process if one has
                                                been started yet, ``None``
                                                otherwise.
        client (:py:class:`socket.socket`): Currently connected client if one
                                            has connected yet, ``None`` otherwise.
        queue (:py:class:`queue.Queue`): Messages received from the socket, but
                                         yet to be retrieved via either
                                         :py:meth:`BeamNGPy.poll` or
                                         :py:meth:`BeamNGPy.poll_all`.
        worker (:py:class:`threading.Thread`): Worker thread reading and parsing
                                               msgpack messages from the client
                                               socket.

    Examples:
        Set up a BeamNGPy instance on localhost and port 64256, using the
        default ``userpath`` and load the scenario ``levels/test/test.json``:

        .. code-block:: python

                bpy.load_scenario('levels/test/test.json')

        Set up a BeamNGPy instance with a custom ``userpath``, load a scenario,
        drive the vehicle for 10s, retrieve its state, and save the screenshot
        to disk:

        .. code-block:: python

            with BeamNGPy('localhost', 64256, userpath='C:/bpy/') as bpy:
